What exactly are MATLABs fixed point capabilities? Why is it special?
Should we build filter using fdesign.nyquist?
If so, should we be comparing with raised cosine? How do we define the cutoff frequency?
Do we have a predefined Fs? If so, is it 8k? If its not predetermined, how do we scale if we can't use M
Do we choose M from fs/(2M)?
Do we scale with this value? what does the 1/20, 4/20, 15/20 mean in this case
How do we verify the sum of frequency responses should be equal to 1 in freq. domain
The scaling we have already is for fixed-point implementation. Is the gain after the filter just to make the sum=1?
For the following code:
	bq = fi(b(:,1), true, B);  % signed = true, B = 16 bits
	L = bq.FractionLength
why is L changing if the size of b and B is the same
Is summing the responses and substracting the input reasonable to check if it was reconstructed?
